# angular-seed-grunt â€” 'angular-seed' wrapped in grunt

Sorry folks, not supporting this anymore.  Have moved my efforts to the [angular-grunt-coffeescript](https://github.com/roytruelove/angular-grunt-coffeescript) project.  Trying to keep in sync with the original angular seed isn't the way to go.
